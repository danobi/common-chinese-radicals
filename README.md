# Common Chinese Radicals

A nicely typeset table of  common radicals in Chinese characters, where all
radicals and example characters are hyperlinked to https://archchinese.com.

# Building

The build is only tested on arch linux, where the following packages are
required:

* `texlive-most`
* `texlive-langchinese`
* `noto-fonts-cjk`
* `noto-fonts`

Then run `make` and `radicals.pdf` should be generated.
